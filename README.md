# BabyStalker

The baby tracking app that allows  you to observe, take note, and save every important thing your baby do! 



## State of the app currently

The app currently has full crud functionality on the baby schema, which is a model that carries the information of an infant and that is linked to other two schemas, the feeding schema and the diaper schema. The idea is that each model will haver their own data based but that will be linked by ids to its respective baby.
